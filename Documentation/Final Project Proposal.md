# Blueprint

# Abstract 

Group Projects make it difficult to track who is responsible for which task and how much has been done. The idea for this project is a task management web application designed for one person, small groups, and even large corporations for light work. However, large corporations will not find a Blueprint to be their ideal program for the project, as it eliminates concepts that can be complicated for people unfamiliar with technology. The Blueprint tracks responsibilities and their completion percentages. For example, a group project involving building an airplane could include several minor tasks such as building wings, engines, legs, and seats. The Blueprint will show 25% done out of 100% when the building wings are built, while engines, legs, and seats are yet to be completed.  The core value in Blueprint is simplicity and an intuitive user interface. The goal of this project is to provide Blueprint as an alternative to existing task management web applications for people who find them too complicated or too heavy for daily use. Therefore, the user interface will be extremely important.

# Description 

Group projects can be an exciting and powerful way to solve a problem, as they bring together many minds and focus them on accomplishing a single task. However, a lack of a task management system can lead to the productivity of a group project being worse than that of a single person working on a project, because as more people become involved, it creates difficulties in tracking who is responsible for which task and how much has been done, which puts an obstacle in the road.

There are existing tools that can be used as alternatives, such as Google Calendar, Trello, and TickTick. Google Calendar is not intuitive enough to add tasks to a schedule. When you open Google Calendar and double-click a date, it provides buttons and text boxes for event details, location, color, default visibility, public or private settings, descriptions, etc. Trello and TickTick provide subscription-based services. They are not free to use, and schedule customization on their platforms can be complex for beginners. Comprehensively, they all lack gamification in their user interfaces. At first glance, their UIs make people feel overwhelmed. Their rigid and business-oriented interfaces discourage users and increase their resistance to engaging with tasks. This embeds in people’s minds a wall between games and work. Therefore, work becomes even more painful to deal with, and ironically, in order to make a group project less time-consuming, users have to spend a long time scheduling tasks in task management web applications.

The idea for this project is a task management web application designed for one person, small groups, and even large corporations for light work. However, large corporations will not find Blueprint to be their ideal program, as it eliminates concepts that can be complicated for people unfamiliar with technology. Blueprint tracks responsibilities and their completion percentages. For example, a group project involving building an airplane could include several minor tasks such as building wings, engines, landing gear, and seats. Blueprint will show 25% done out of 100% when the wings are completed, while engines, landing gear, and seats are yet to be completed. The core value of Blueprint is simplicity and an intuitive user interface. The goal of this project is to provide Blueprint as an alternative to existing task management web applications for people who find them too complicated or too heavy for daily use. Therefore, the user interface will be extremely important.

A friendly user interface can be achieved in numerous ways. One way is having a small pixel animation that slices the schedule box once a task is completed, accompanied by a slashing sound. This part will be done very carefully, as overuse of such animations and sounds will interrupt the user’s focus on work. Second is a cautious combination of colors in the design and appropriate use of images. For example, Blueprint will avoid designs such as a mixture of solid blue and white with all text written in 8-point Times New Roman. Text must be larger, and our intention is to confuse the user’s brain into perceiving work time as play time. Third is delete, delete, delete. Users do not need YouTube, Google Maps, news, photos, or Drive logos on the side of a task management website. They are all distractions. Fourth is make it work and go faster. If a user clicks the website and it reacts in five seconds, that will ruin the meaning of this project. The website must be fast, comparable to locally running software.

A key advantage of using Blueprint is accountability and transparency. Team members are able to clearly see how much work each person is responsible for. Everyone will have equal access to the information and anyone can question strategies they disagree with. This transparency helps reduce misunderstanding and prevents the conflict that rises from the miscommunication and unequal workloads. Members will build trust with each other and it will also prevent accountability dodging. As a result, Blueprint will bring collaboration improvement. 

Another important aspect of Blueprint is its impact on the user's motivation and engagement over time. Many task management tools solely focus on efficiency, overlooking the emotional stress experience of the user working on a task. One is more likely to procrastinate the project with emotional stress. By creating a friendly and less intimidating environment, Blueprint will provide reduced psychological resistances users will have to face and this approach helps users remain engaged to the project.

In conclusion, while existing tools aim to improve productivity in group projects, many of them are either too complex or subscription-based. Blueprint aims to provide a free lightweight web application that emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and accountability by minimizing distractions and focusing on essential functionality rather than unnecessary features.

# Feature List 

Features we will complete this semester: 

* A login provided by Google’s free API.   
* A task list that the user can edit and delete.  
* A project deadline set by the user.  
* A task list with the priority set by the user (high, medium, low).  
* A calendar that the user can alone to track events, such as task and project due dates. If there are multiple users, the calendar can be used to compare members’ schedules and find the best time for meetings.  
* An alarm set by the user to remind them of the deadlines.  
* Binding accounts with third-party apps, such as Google, Facebook, and X.  
* A “Manager” title that will be granted to the creator of the Blueprint, who can set what others see and give this title to.


Features we will complete if there is time:

* The user interface with gamification elements. For example, when a task is completed, the UI may display a brief animation, such as defeating a monster with a sword-strike sound effect. These animations will be designed to be minimal and non-intrusive, so they do not interrupt core functions or distract the user from work.   
* An API call to ChatGPT to provide recommended instructions to the user.


Features we would like to implement, but won’t be able to complete by the end of this semester: 

* A link to the user’s email that Blueprint will use to read your entire email and send an alarm as a task that the user can either accept or deny by clicking the check or X displayed.  
* An API call to ChatGPT that gives you advice on how each task can be done.

# Server Information 

We will be using Vercel to host the server for this project.

# Data Sources 

This project does not require any external data sources.

# AI Statement 

AI Chatbots will be treated as a fifth member of the group. That is to say, it will be responsible for (roughly) 20% of the work. Additionally, we will be using the free tiers of both Google’s Gemini and Figma. The team will only use AI for technical help, inspiration, and debugging. We will not be using any AI-generated code in this project.

# Team Members’ Backgrounds

* Jeongha Park

  I majored in general computer science. I have experience with creating and hosting websites. I once had too many video games downloaded on my computer that each game was 40 gigabytes. I faced a shortage in computer storage, so I made a game management website that I could add a box of game links with images and description of the game attached to it to the list and play them later. I used html, css, and javascript at the time I created the website. I also studied algorithms and analysis in java.  

* Jacob McPherson  
  I have extensive experience with database creation and management. I am proficient with SQL. I also have broad technical expertise across many programming languages, including Java, Python, HTML, JS, and CSS. I have used the React framework before, but I am still new to it.  
* Isaac Trejo Mendoza  
  After four years studying as a software engineer at APSU I have learned Java, TypeScript, and C. In my own time I have also learned HTML, CSS, JS & TS, and C\#. During my 4 year degree I have acquired experience in creating and hosting full stack applications using web programming frameworks, databases, and APIs and software design principles. I want to continue to learn about all of these to further benefit my team and career. With my knowledge in system architecture, object oriented programming, and familiarity with the relevant programming languages, I am sure to bring what it takes for this project.  
* Obadiah Sieg  
  As a computer science major, I have knowledge on both the front and back-end of programming. Additionally, with having a focus in Software Engineering, I have a deeper level of understanding on both program efficiency and analysis. Earlier, in high school, I learned C\# through video game development using Unity, but that will not be used in this project. Throughout college, I have had the pleasure of working with Java, Fortran, C, TypeScript, Racket, Haskell, and Ruby. Altogether, I believe I have the experience to see this project to fruition. 

# Dependencies, Limitations, and Risks

* Dependencies: Supabase, Vercel, and Google’s free login API.  
* Limitations: all assets must be free, unless team members agree on paid assets, and it will only be available as a web application. There will not be a downloadable app for this application.   
* Risks: Oversights due to the team’s skill gaps, the project may be more difficult to complete, forcing us to draw back, and data conflicts, as multiple people and applications are involved in this project.

	To address these issues, we plan to display an error message to the user when the site is down due to a dependency not functioning, use only royalty-free libraries, and create our own simple graphics in Figma. Furthermore, we will use real-time database updates via Supabase to prevent data conflicts. If the project becomes too large, we will draw back accordingly.
